Project Brief
-------------

**Assigment 3: Feed aggregator**

You will create an application to retrieve and save rss feeds into a database.

Users should be able to subscribe and manage their accounts, manage the feeds they wants to follow, archive / bookmark / socially publish the posts and define a feed that they follow as public or private on their profile and see other user profiles and feeds.

The efficiency of the DB is a primary concern - multiple subscriptions to a single feed should cause it to be stored only once.
